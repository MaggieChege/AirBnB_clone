# AirBnB clone - The console
<br>
The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at ALX School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

## Storage

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the FileStorage class.

Every time the backend is initialized, AirBnB_clone instantiates an instance of FileStorage called storage.

 The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding changes in the file.json.
